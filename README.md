My learning Git and Github repository.

Hello github world!
I'm new to git and just starting to learn about it. I'm starting with the 'Hello World' Github Guide. I started Harvard's CS50x back in Janauary and have been saving my projects into a private repository here but I haven't actually taken any time to better understand git and/or github until now. Time to get started!
